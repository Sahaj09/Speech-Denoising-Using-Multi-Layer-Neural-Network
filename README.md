# Speech-Denoising-Using-Multi-Layer-Neural-Network

***Question2.ipynb contains the code for the repo***

The repository contains .ipynb file that contains the code and the repo also contains 4 other files, 2 files contain training data (noisy audio and clean audio) and the other 2 audio files are test data. 

Here we use, the the train_dirty data as input and use train_clean as labels for train_dirty. The aim of the program is to develop a neural network that generates clean audio when dirty audio is feeded to it. 
(Note: the dirty audio contains a person's voice along with some kind of background noise)

After training we use the two test audio files to generate clean audio files of the test file.
